                <p>Live shipment tracking helps improve the supply chain management process. 
                    Buyers and sellers can gain visibility into transit times, identify potential bottlenecks, and optimize their operational processes. 
                    Visibility helps drive improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness, both for the shipment in progress and future shipments. 

                    Shipment tracking also plays a role in customer satisfaction. Even if shipments are delayed, 
                    real-time updates regarding a shipment supply customers with a better understanding of why their goods have been delayed. 
                    This transparency allows them to plan accordingly and gives them a measure of control. 
                    Offering live shipment tracking insights to customers can significantly build trust and foster a strong, 
                    long-term relationship. </p>
